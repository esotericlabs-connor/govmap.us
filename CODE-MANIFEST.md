## Build log

**2026-07-24 — UI redesign pass (Gemini) + Claude finalize**
Second Gemini polish loop ([[gemini-division-of-labor]]) — a full visual system pass: a warm-neutral palette (`slate-warm`), refined `shadow-card`/`-hover`, new keyframes (`slide-down-and-fade`, `ring`), an animated seat-chart with a floating tooltip + ZIP-highlight ring, sticky glassy header with an animated chamber-tab glider (`ChamberTabs`), streaming detail pages (`<Suspense>` + `PageSkeleton`), and restyled hero/cards throughout. **Gemini respected the guardrails**: no backend/`lib/api.ts`/`package.json` edits, no new deps, no external requests (fonts stay build-time `next/font`), server/client boundaries intact, no invented API fields. **Claude finalize pass fixed:** a self-referential CSS var in the cartogram (`--color-govblue: var(--color-govblue)` — it would have invalidated the var that `FinanceCard` relies on) + its now-dead `FILL`/`useEffect`; missing `slate-warm-700/800` shades (used but undefined); a duplicate `DetailKit` import; slimmed `PageSkeleton` so it doesn't nest a second `<main>`/back-link inside detail pages. **Also built the two missing index pages** (`/bills`, `/votes`) that Gemini added to the header nav — server components over the existing `/api/bills` + `/api/votes` list endpoints — and pointed the bill/vote detail back-links at them. Lesson holds: the finalize pass owns reconciling anything Gemini couldn't verify against the running stack.

**2026-07-24 — Bill summaries + full text ("what this bill does")**
Every enriched bill now carries the official **CRS summary** (Congress.gov `/summaries`, HTML stripped to plain text in the normalizer — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) and a link to the latest **full-text version** (`/text`, preferring Formatted Text → PDF → any). Schema 0008 adds `bills.summary`/`summary_date`/`text_url`/`text_version` (distinct from the reserved LLM `summary_plain_english`); `congress_gov_bills` fetches 2 more sub-resources per bill (~5 calls/bill now) and the normalizer keeps the most recent of each. The bill detail page gains a "What this bill does" section (plain-English summary + a "Read the full text ↗" button). Coverage tracks the enriched-bills set (the most-recently-updated N); `member_sponsored` index rows show it once they cycle through enrichment. **Next for bills:** widen enrichment past the current cap toward the full corpus.

**2026-07-24 — Finance hardening + coverage; ruff pinned; ZIP self-discovery; Mastodon**
Post-deploy fixes from the finance rollout. **FEC key wiring:** `FEC_API_KEY` (+ `FEC_CYCLE`) added to the backend `environment:` block in `docker-compose.yml` — a value in `.env` alone is only used for `${...}` substitution and never reached the container (same mechanism as `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY`). **Rate limits:** the per-member `/candidate/{id}/totals` design (~537 calls) blew past api.data.gov's ~1000/hr, so only ~30% loaded; rewrote `fec_finance` to the **bulk** `/candidates/totals` endpoint (a handful of paginated calls per chamber). **Coverage:** a single cycle only lists candidates running *that* cycle, so ~2/3 of senators were missing — now sweeps `_CYCLE_SPAN` cycles (newest-first, first row wins) so every Senate class + the House is covered. **Deploy hot path:** `refresh` (deploy step) runs CORE only (`members`, `bills`, `votes`); `sponsored_bills`/`finance`/`zip_districts` moved to `EXTRA_REFRESHERS` (scheduler + `python -m app.pipelines.refresh <name>|all`). **Lint:** added `backend/ruff.toml` (deterministic `select = [E,F,UP,B]`, ignore `B008`, exclude `migrations/`) because CI's unpinned ruff kept turning red on default-ruleset drift; fixed one real UP017 (`datetime.UTC`). **ZIP:** `zip_crosswalk` now discovers its file from the Census directory listing (the hard-coded name 404'd). **Frontend:** dropped the X/Twitter social link, added Mastodon (`site-config` + a `mastodon` `BrandIcon` glyph).

**2026-07-23 — Member-data accuracy fixes + campaign finance (Increment 4a)**
Paused feature work to fix member-data accuracy and add the first financial data. **Accuracy:** (1) "In office since" showed the *current* term's start (Jan 3 2025 for everyone re-elected into the 119th) — added `members.served_since` (0006), computed by walking back through contiguous same-chamber terms (Cantwell → 2001, Rogers → 2003; `term_start` kept, now meaning "current term began"). (2) Sponsored-bill counts reflected only the 250-bill enriched slice — added a per-member pipeline (`congress_member_sponsored`) hitting `/member/{bioguide}/sponsored-legislation` for the current Congress and upserting bill "index" rows (identity + title + latest action, sponsor = the member) **without** touching the enriched actions/cosponsors; the member endpoint now returns the true `sponsored_bills_total`. (3) Moved the Source-IDs strip to the bottom of the member page. **Finance (Increment 4a):** `member_finance` table (0007; per member per cycle) + `fec_finance` pipeline pulling OpenFEC `/candidate/{id}/totals` for each member's current-office FEC candidate id (chosen by `S`/`H` prefix) — receipts / disbursements / cash-on-hand / debts + the individual-vs-PAC-vs-party receipts split; key sent as the `X-Api-Key` header, never a URL param. New `FinanceCard` renders topline tiles + a proportional receipts-source bar on the member page. Requires `FEC_API_KEY` (free DATA.gov key) — **fail-soft/skipped without it**, exactly like the bills pipeline. Both new pipelines read the legislators staging file (DB-free) and register in `refresh_all` (+ daily scheduler jobs). **Budget note:** each deploy's `refresh_all` now adds ~537 Congress.gov + ~537 OpenFEC calls; both back off on 429. **Next:** named top donors + industries (OpenSecrets / Schedule A itemization), and widen bill/vote coverage.

**2026-07-23 — Congress dashboard + self-contained seat map + ZIP→reps lookup; front-page polish**
Turned the platform entry into a visual view of Congress. **Backend (all additive):** `zip_districts` table (0005; composite PK `(zip, state, district)`) + `zip_crosswalk.py` pipeline (public **Census ZCTA↔CD relationship file** — no auth, fetch-at-refresh like every other source; resolves the ZCTA/CD columns *by name prefix* and tries `cd119`→`cd118` so a redistricting-year publish gap can't break the pull; drops water-only slivers) + `normalize/zip_districts.py` (full delete+reload, chunked under the 32767-param cap), registered in `refresh.py` + a monthly scheduler job. New `routers/congress.py`: `/api/map` (party/link index keyed `STATE-DISTRICT` for the House, by state for the Senate — derived **entirely from `members`, zero new data dependency**), `/api/summary` (per-chamber D/R/I balance), `/api/lookup?zip=` (5-digit-validated → your senators by state + representative(s) by state+district; a boundary-straddling ZIP returns every match). **Frontend:** `/congress` (`force-dynamic`) is now the platform entry — `siteConfig.appUrl`, both "Enter GovMap" CTAs, and a new "Congress" nav item point here. `CongressCartogram` is a **self-contained computed hemicycle**: every seat is one member, party-colored from `/api/map`, hover-to-identify, click→profile, House/Senate toggle — no map tiles, no geometry files, no third-party requests (chosen over a geographic polygon map because district geometry can't be produced on the static build box — the geographic upgrade is deferred, see open items). `ZipLookup` + `CongressExplorer` tie the ZIP box to the chart (your reps get ringed); `ChamberSplit` shows the two chambers with party-balance bars; `/members` gains `[All|House|Senate]` tabs (`?chamber=`). **Front-page polish:** hero → "See your **government** clearly." (white-on-blue highlight box + red *clearly.*); the "Enter GovMap"/"How it works" CTAs are solid-but-glassy; the header bar is full-width (logo pinned far-left, nav far-right).

**2026-07-23 — UX visual polish (Gemini) + Claude finalize pass**
First real run of the Claude-builds / Gemini-polishes loop ([[gemini-division-of-labor]]): Gemini restyled the detail pages, `DetailKit`, roster, and search into a cohesive light "civic dashboard" (member profile header + stat strip, a proportional yea/nay tally bar and by-position grouping on votes, a vertical action timeline on bills, chair/ranking-hoisted committee rosters, member cards with avatars, a polished dark search dropdown) — no new dependencies, server/client boundaries intact. Claude's finalize pass then reconciled where Gemini's design outran the API contract: added `photo_url` to the bill-sponsor and committee-member query+response (so their avatars have a source) and to the matching `lib/api` types; added a `CommitteeMember` type alias; corrected the votes `totals` annotation to `Record<string, number | null>`; fixed the search empty-state check (it was counting the `query` string) and an invisible party dot; dropped unused imports. Lesson for future Gemini hand-offs: it will reach for fields/types that "should" exist — the finalize pass owns reconciling the data contract.

**2026-07-23 — Platform UX baseline: detail pages + universal search**
Turned the Legislative data into a navigable platform (the "SIEM for government" surface). **Backend:** `/api/search` — one grouped typeahead endpoint over members/bills/votes/committees (bound-parameter ILIKE with escaped LIKE metacharacters, length-bounded query, hard per-group caps; structured to add entity types). **Frontend baseline (Claude builds wiring + a plain-but-consistent baseline; Gemini does the visual polish — see [[gemini-division-of-labor]]):** `lib/api.ts` (typed responses + `serverApiBase()` vs build-time `publicApiBase`, `apiGet` that maps 404→notFound), `components/DetailKit.tsx` (shared server-safe primitives — `Section`/`Stat`/`PositionPill`/`CodePill`/`BackLink` + party/date helpers — the single restyle target), and four SSR detail pages: `/members/[bioguide]` (bio, cross-source IDs, committees, sponsored bills, voting record), `/bills/[billId]` (sponsor, action timeline, cosponsors), `/votes/[voteId]` (tallies + every member's position), `/committees/[committeeId]` (majority/minority roster). Every entity cross-links by bioguide, so a search result → member → their votes → a vote → other members all navigate. `components/UniversalSearch.tsx` is a debounced/abortable client typeahead wired into `SiteHeader` (centered on desktop app pages, in the mobile menu to keep the fixed-header height constant so `pt-24` still clears it); the roster rows now link to detail. All detail pages are `force-dynamic` (backend unreachable at image build). Deferred/next: visual polish (Gemini), a ZIP→district Mapbox map, bill/vote list pages, keyboard nav in search.

**2026-07-23 — Votes (Increment 3b — House Clerk + Senate LIS)**
Roll-call votes from the two authoritative XML sources, and the **id_crosswalk's first real cross-source payoff**. **Schema (0004):** `votes` (keyed `{h|s}{congress}-{session}-{roll}`, chamber/date/question/result/bill_id/totals JSONB/source_url) + `vote_positions` ((vote_id, bioguide_id), position). bioguide indexed, not FK (same current-only reasoning as bills). **Pipelines (a third source shape — parsed XML, so no Pydantic `*Raw`; manual `xml.etree` parse that skips bad rows, fails if none):** `house_clerk_votes.py` (clerk.house.gov/evs/{year}/roll{NNN}.xml — binary-searches the current max roll, pulls the most-recent VOTES_LIMIT newest-first; **House `name-id` IS the Bioguide ID** → positions join members directly) and `senate_lis_votes.py` (LIS menu → newest N individual vote files; **Senate keys members by `lis_member_id`, NOT bioguide**). **Both set a descriptive `User-Agent`** — the Clerk 403s the default requests UA. **Normalizer** `votes.py` loads a `id_crosswalk.lis → bioguide` map and resolves every Senate position through it (unresolved positions skipped + counted); House positions bind bioguide directly. Chunked inserts under the 32767-param cap (100 House votes × ~435 members ≈ 43k position rows). **Orchestration:** one `refresh_votes` runs both chamber pulls independently (one down → 'partial', both down → raise), then the shared normalizer; 30-min scheduler interval. **API:** `/api/votes` (filter chamber/congress/session/bill_id) + `/api/votes/{vote_id}` (every position, names left-joined); `/api/members/{bioguide}` gains `voting_record`. Config: `CONGRESS_SESSION` (2 = 2026), `VOTES_LIMIT`. Legislative core (members, committees, bills, votes) now flows end-to-end for the 119th.

**2026-07-22 — Bills (Increment 3a — Congress.gov)**
First data from the Congress.gov v3 API: current-Congress bills with sponsor, action timeline, and cosponsors. **Schema (0003):** `bills` (keyed `{type}{number}-{congress}`, e.g. `hr1-119`), `bill_actions` (per-bill timeline, full-replaced each refresh), `cosponsors`. Sponsor/cosponsor bioguide columns are **indexed but not FKs** — a bill's actors can include members no longer in the current-only `members` table; bioguide stays the logical join key without enforcing RI across that boundary. `status` is intentionally minimal (only the source-derived "Became Law"); the full truth lives in `bill_actions` (data-only, no invented status taxonomy). `summary_plain_english` exists but stays null (LLM work on hold). **Pipeline** (`congress_gov_bills.py`): bounded + incremental — pulls the most-recently-updated bills (`sort=updateDate desc`) up to `CONGRESS_GOV_BILL_LIMIT` (default 250), each enriched with detail + actions + cosponsors, so scheduled runs keep the "what's moving" set fresh and raising the cap widens coverage. The API key is sent as the **`X-Api-Key` header, never a URL param**, so it can't leak into exceptions/logs/`pipeline_status.detail`. **Normalizer** re-validates staged JSON through the `*Raw` schemas (so dates deserialize to `date` objects) and chunks inserts under Postgres' 32767-param cap. **API:** `/api/bills` (filter by congress/type/sponsor/policy_area) + `/api/bills/{bill_id}` (sponsor + actions + cosponsors, names left-joined from members); `/api/members/{bioguide}` gains `sponsored_bills`. Registered in `refresh.py` + scheduler (30-min interval). Config: `CONGRESS_NUMBER` (119, bump in 2027), `CONGRESS_GOV_BILL_LIMIT`. **Next: 3b — votes** (House Clerk XML + Senate LIS XML → `votes`, `vote_positions`; Senate votes arrive keyed by LIS ID, resolved to bioguide via `id_crosswalk` — the crosswalk's first real payoff).

**2026-07-22 — Legislative foundation (Increments 0-2 of the branch build)**
Started the Legislative-branch build-out (current 119th Congress; see the approved plan). **Schema (0002):** extends `members` (birthday/gender/contact/social/in_office/leadership_role) and adds `id_crosswalk` (the Bioguide → FEC/OpenSecrets/govtrack/… join backbone), `committees` + `committee_memberships`, and promotes `pipeline_status` from a JSON file to a table. Models live in `app/models/` and are all imported in `migrations/env.py`. Migration is hand-written (mirrors `0001`) since the build box has no Alembic; it applies on the server via `alembic upgrade head` at container start. **Observability (Inc 1):** `app/pipelines/status.py::record_run()` persists per-source status (+ optional `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`); `app/pipelines/refresh.py` is the single pull→normalize→status orchestration that both the scheduler and `scripts/deploy.sh` call (`python -m app.pipelines.refresh`); `app/scheduler.py` is now a job registry; `/internal/pipeline-status` reads the table. **Data (Inc 2):** the `congress_legislators` pipeline now stages three files (legislators + committees-current + committee-membership-current) and normalizers populate members (enriched), `id_crosswalk`, `committees`, and `committee_memberships`. **API:** `/api/committees` (+ `/{id}` detail with members) and `/api/members/{bioguide}` (detail with cross-source IDs + committee seats). Later increments: bills/votes (0003), finance/lobbying/disclosures (0004), member detail page (Inc 5).

### The golden pipeline pattern (clone this for every new source)

`congress_legislators` is the reference. A source is three layers, one file each:
1. **Pipeline** (`app/pipelines/<source>.py`): pull → validate with a Pydantic `*Raw` schema (skip individually bad rows, raise if none survive) → write staging JSON. DB-free (network + filesystem only). Runnable via `python -m ...`.
2. **Normalizer** (`app/normalize/<entity>.py`): read staging → map to canonical rows (apply the Bioguide/ID-crosswalk + ISO-8601 rules) → `pg_insert(...).on_conflict_do_update(...)` upsert.
3. **Orchestration + API**: register a `refresh_<source>()` in `app/pipelines/refresh.py` (`REFRESHERS`) and a cadence in `app/scheduler.py` (`JOBS`); add a router in `app/routers/`. `refresh_<source>()` records status via `record_run()`.

Two reference implementations exist to clone from:
- **Bulk-file source** → `congress_legislators` (one download, validate a list, stage). Best when the source publishes a full dataset.
- **Keyed REST API** → `congress_gov_bills` (paginate a list endpoint, then per-key fetch detail + sub-resources; bounded + incremental via an update-date sort; auth key in a **header**, never the URL; chunked inserts under Postgres' 32767-param cap; re-validate staged JSON in the normalizer so dates round-trip). Best for api.congress.gov / api.data.gov / FEC-style APIs.

**2026-07-22 — Design system + landing/app polish pass**
Comprehensive front-end design pass establishing a shared system the whole app inherits. Typography via `next/font` (Space Grotesk display + Inter body → CSS vars, wired into Tailwind `fontFamily`). New shared components: `SiteHeader` (fixed, glass-on-scroll, mobile hamburger; `marketing`/`app` variants), `SiteFooter` (Capitol backdrop, Explore/Project/Legal columns, social icons), `Reveal` (IntersectionObserver scroll-fade, reduced-motion-safe), `LegalLayout`. Landing hero gets a staggered on-load fade-up (pure CSS) and stronger scrim; About/Support fade in on scroll. Draft `/privacy` and `/security` pages. Root body is now navy so mobile overscroll blends into the dark hero/footer (iOS paints only the root bg-color in the rubber-band, so color-matching is the reliable fix). Added OpenGraph/Twitter card metadata (Capitol image) for rich social shares. Social links are placeholder `@govmapus` (X/Bluesky/Instagram) pending real accounts. Tokens: `govnavy-800`, `fade-up`/`fade-in` keyframes, `shadow-card`. No new runtime dependencies (motion is CSS + a tiny observer; icons stay inlined). **Note:** `next/font/google` fetches fonts at build time — the Docker build needs network (it already has it for npm).

Follow-up tweaks: header gained a **Sign in** link → `/account` placeholder ("accounts coming soon" — real auth/benefits TBD by the user); hero heading recolored for legibility over the bright image ("See your" white, "government." govred, "Clearly." bright blue `#5cb3ff`) with text-shadows, subtext brightened to white; hero copy updated ("end-to-end live-synced view", "No press. No spin.").

**2026-07-22 — Landing page: Capitol hero, transparent logo, support links**
Redesigned the marketing hero with a US Capitol sunset photo (`public/capitol-hero.jpg`) behind a navy gradient for legibility. Fixed the "off-color box" logo: the logo PNG's baked background is `#0A0E1E` but the page navy is `#070B1A`, so it read as a rectangle — generated `logo-dark-transparent.png` (alpha-keyed the dark background out, verified clean) and use it as the home-button logo everywhere on dark surfaces; the opaque `logo-dark.png`/`logo-light.png` are kept as the primary brand assets. Added a Support section with six active donation platforms (Patreon, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, Liberapay, Open Collective, thanks.dev) rendered with Simple Icons brand glyphs (`components/BrandIcon.tsx`, inlined — no icon dependency), plus a **"seeking a fiscal sponsor"** callout. `site-config` gained `supportLinks[]`; the unused `supportUrl` was removed.

**2026-07-22 — Redeploy hardening + full stack live in production**
Site live end-to-end at govmap.us through the dashboard-managed tunnel (marketing, `/members` with real portraits + party colors, 537 members). Made redeploy fully reproducible: root `.env.example` documents the two required secrets (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`); `deploy.sh` now writes a self-documenting `.env` on a fresh box and flags the missing tunnel token; README gained a "Rebuilding on a fresh box" runbook. **Key operational fact: the tunnel is dashboard-managed, so its routes live in Cloudflare and survive any rebuild — the only per-box state is `.env`.** Reconnecting a rebuilt box = restore `.env` (or re-fetch the token from the CF dashboard) + `bash scripts/deploy.sh`. Tunnel ID `ebdeb681-961d-4321-8beb-2f14b35c6143`.

**2026-07-22 — Cloudflare Tunnel as a stack service**
Moved the tunnel from a per-box systemd unit (fragile: interactive `tunnel login`, on-disk credentials that can't live in the repo, and the source of a rebuild's Error 1033) into the compose stack. New `cloudflared` service runs a **dashboard-managed** tunnel via a token from `.env` (`CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`), under a `tunnel` compose profile that `scripts/deploy.sh` enables automatically when the token is present. So `docker compose up` now brings the public site up too, and rebuilding a box is just "restore the token to `.env`." Ingress (public hostnames → `http://frontend:3000` / `http://backend:8000`) is configured once in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard; cloudflared shares the compose network so those service names resolve. The old CLI/systemd tunnel should be uninstalled (`sudo cloudflared service uninstall`) and its dashboard tunnel deleted.

**2026-07-21 — Single-source deploy script**
Added `scripts/deploy.sh` as the one deploy path: `git reset --hard origin/main` → ensure `.env` (generates `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` if missing) → `docker compose up -d --build` → poll `/health` (backend migrates on start) → refresh data (pipeline + normalize, non-fatal so a source outage can't fail the deploy) → prune → verify `photo_url` is populated. Idempotent, re-runnable, never touches `.env` or the Postgres volume. Takes `--no-data` for code-only changes. The GitHub Actions runner now just calls `bash /opt/govmap/scripts/deploy.sh`, so manual and automated deploys are literally the same script — no more copy-pasted command sequences, and a reliable manual deploy exists whenever the runner is down.

**2026-07-21 — Member photos + roster polish + branding**
Swapped `logo-dark.png`/`logo-light.png` for tight cropped lockups (the originals had large baked-in margins that made the wordmark render tiny) and resized every logo `<Image>` to the new ~3.13:1 aspect. Added **member portraits**: `normalize/members.py` now sets `photo_url` to the deterministic unitedstates/images URL (`https://unitedstates.github.io/images/congress/225x275/{bioguide}.jpg`, verified 200 image/jpeg) — no separate pull pipeline since the URL is fully derivable from the Bioguide ID. The roster renders them via a small `MemberAvatar` client component that falls back to initials on 404/missing, plus party-colored labels (govred/govblue). Added a targeted `.gitattributes` (LF for `*.sh`/`*.yml`/`Dockerfile`, binary for images) to end the CRLF churn and guarantee the deploy script stays LF on the Linux host.

Note: `photo_url` was previously left null by the normalizer (it was reserved for a separate images pipeline). Setting it deterministically means an existing DB needs one normalize run to backfill — future weekly scheduler runs handle it automatically.

**2026-07-21 — Closed the operational loop**
With the pipeline proven live, automated the parts that were manual. (1) **Auto-deploy**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` now runs on push to `main` via a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on the VM — it `git reset --hard`s `/opt/govmap` to `origin/main` and `docker compose up -d --build`s (backend re-applies Alembic migrations on start). No SSH, no exposed ports. Runner install is a one-time server-side step (needs a GitHub registration token). (2) **Scheduler**: `backend/app/scheduler.py` (APScheduler, wired into the FastAPI lifespan) refreshes members weekly (Sun 07:00 UTC) so data no longer depends on a manual run. (3) **Secured `/internal/*`**: HTTP Basic Auth via `INTERNAL_USER`/`INTERNAL_PASSWORD`, locked by default when unset — it was reachable at `api.govmap.us/internal/*` with no auth. (4) **Fixed the roster cap**: the members query was hardcoded to `limit=535`, silently hiding the ~2 non-voting delegates the pipeline loads (537 total); raised to 600 on both API and frontend. Nightly `pg_dump` backups remain a server-side cron (see server hardening notes).

**2026-07-21 — Flattened frontend routing (fixed blank-page bug)**
The first deploy rendered blank: every page served HTML with no `<!DOCTYPE html>`/`<html>`/`<body>` (Quirks Mode + React #418/#423 hydration failure → React tore the tree down). Ruled out Cloudflare (Bot Fight Mode / JS Detections injection was a real but secondary red herring) and the middleware (removing it didn't help). Root cause: **the platform routes lived under `app/app/` — a route segment literally named `app` inside the App Router's own `app/` directory — which corrupted route resolution so Next.js used `app/app/layout.tsx` (a bare `<div>`, no `<html>`) as the root and skipped the real `app/layout.tsx` entirely.**

Fix: collapsed to a standard flat structure — marketing at `app/page.tsx` (`/`), members at `app/members/page.tsx` (`/members`), no nested `app/app/`, no middleware. **Deferred: the govmap.us / app.govmap.us subdomain split.** It required host-based rewriting (middleware or `app/app/` nesting) and was the source of this whole class of pain; re-introduce it only once the flat app is proven stable, using a tested approach (config-level `rewrites` or separate concerns). `cloudflared` still routes `app.govmap.us` → `localhost:3000`, which now just serves the same content as `govmap.us` — harmless; drop that ingress line when convenient. `middleware.ts` and `site-config`'s subdomain URLs were removed.

**2026-07-21 — Containerized deploy layer**
Added `backend/Dockerfile` (migrations-on-start + uvicorn, non-root) and a multi-stage `frontend/Dockerfile` (Next.js `standalone` output, non-root runner). Extended `docker-compose.yml` from Postgres-only to the full stack: `postgres` + `backend` (`127.0.0.1:8000`) + `frontend` (`127.0.0.1:3000`), all loopback-bound so `cloudflared` reaches them over localhost and nothing is publicly exposed. Server-side rendering in the frontend now reaches the backend over the internal compose network (`API_INTERNAL_URL=http://backend:8000`); `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prod URLs are baked at build time via compose build args. First real production deploy target: the home Ubuntu VM behind the `govmap` cloudflared tunnel (govmap.us / app.govmap.us / api.govmap.us).

**2026-07-20 — Brand assets + marketing/platform split**
Received the first brand assets: `logo-dark.png` / `logo-light.png` (full lockups, opaque backgrounds baked in — not transparent, so they're placed as full-bleed treatments, not floated over arbitrary backgrounds). Sampled exact colors from the artwork rather than eyeballing hex values: navy `#070B1A`, red `#DD1922`, blue `#58A9E6`, now in `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` as `govnavy`/`govred`/`govblue`. Cropped a square Capitol-only mark from the dark logo (no source icon-only asset existed) for `frontend/app/icon.png`.

Split the frontend into two zones on one Next.js deployment: **govmap.us** (marketing site, `app/page.tsx`) and **app.govmap.us** (the platform, moved to `app/app/`), routed by hostname in `frontend/middleware.ts`. Cross-zone links (marketing's "Enter GovMap" button, the platform header's link back) go through `frontend/lib/site-config.ts` since they need to be absolute URLs, not relative paths, once the two zones are on different hosts in production. Social handles and a support/donation link are left empty in that config — nothing fake ships in the footer.

**2026-07-20 — Repo scaffold + pilot pipeline started**
Consolidated the original planning notes (six documents, written across earlier drafts with some mutual inconsistencies — see *Reconciliation notes* below) into this file, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Decided to prove the full pipeline contract (pull → validate → normalize → store → serve → display) on a single source — `congress-legislators` — end-to-end through a minimal FastAPI + Next.js stack, before parallelizing to the remaining 24 sources. LLM summarization and Redis caching are explicitly deferred (see `AGENTS.md` → Current explicit boundaries).

## Reconciliation notes

The original planning docs disagreed with each other in a few places. Resolved as follows:

- **Source count**: 25 sources (confirmed against the masterlist's own "25 total" tally).
- **JSON output count**: 24 canonical outputs — 23 domain outputs plus `pipeline_status.json` as the operational/health output. (One earlier doc's table listed only 23 total because it predated the addition of the Senate LDA and Financial Disclosures sources; another doc's checklist heading said "23 JSON output" but its own criteria table lists 24 — that was a leftover from before those two sources were added, not a real disagreement.)
- **Senate LDA source**: the original note that `lda.senate.gov` "shuts down June 30 2026" is confirmed and the site now redirects to **lda.gov**, with API docs at `lda.senate.gov/api/`. Build the `senate_lda.py` pipeline against the current `lda.gov` endpoint, not the legacy domain. API access is already in hand.
- **Repo folder structure doc**: discarded. It was carried over from an unrelated project (financial dashboard) and doesn't fit GovMap's domain. The structure actually in use is documented below under *Repository layout*.
- **Frontend framework**: Next.js (App Router), not the earlier draft's Vite + React Router.
- **Hosting**: self-hosted home VM behind `cloudflared` (no exposed ports), Tailscale-only SSH, GitHub Actions deploy — not the earlier draft's Hetzner VPS + Coolify. This is a deliberate cheap-and-temporary choice; see README's Tech stack section.
- **OpenSecrets bulk data license** ("free, non-commercial") confirmed compatible with GovMap's nonprofit, non-advertising model.

## Canonical JSON outputs (24)

`members.json`, `votes.json`, `bills.json`, `campaign_finance.json`, `executive_officials.json`, `executive_actions.json`, `agencies.json`, `judges.json`, `opinions.json`, `spending.json`, `districts.json`, `scotus_cases.json`, `federal_cases.json`, `state_legislators.json`, `state_bills.json`, `state_executives.json`, `state_court_stats.json`, `state_districts.json`, `demographics.json`, `government_finances.json`, `local_legislation.json`, `local_officials.json`, `lobbying.json`, `financial_disclosures.json`, plus `pipeline_status.json`.

Field-level schemas per output carry over from the original planning docs unchanged; they're not reproduced here to avoid a second copy drifting out of sync — add them to the relevant Pydantic schema module as each output is actually built, since that's the version that has to be correct.

Note: `bills.json`, `executive_actions.json`, `opinions.json`, and `state_bills.json` originally specced a `summary_plain_english` field. That field is not being populated right now — see `AGENTS.md` → Current explicit boundaries. The schemas keep the field as nullable so it can be filled in later without a breaking migration.

## Phase checklist

Adapted from the original end-to-end plan, reordered to prove the pipeline contract on one source before fanning out — see the 2026-07-20 build log entry for why.

- [x] Repo scaffold, `.gitignore`, three canonical docs
- [ ] **Pilot**: `congress-legislators` pipeline → normalize → `members` table → `/api/members` → Next.js list page, running locally end-to-end
- [ ] Local dev loop verified (Postgres via `docker-compose`, backend, frontend all running together)
- [ ] CI: lint workflow green on push
- [ ] Fan out to remaining 24 source pipelines (Layer 1), reusing the pilot's pattern
- [ ] Normalization layer for all entities (Layer 2), `id_crosswalk` table populated
- [ ] All 24 JSON outputs live (Layer 3)
- [ ] FastAPI backend complete: all endpoints, Redis caching added *when needed*, APScheduler wiring
- [ ] Next.js frontend — Legislative branch complete
- [ ] Next.js frontend — Executive & Judicial branches
- [ ] Full cross-branch bill pipeline view
- [ ] Security hardening pass (rate limiting, CORS, dependency audit, load test)
- [ ] Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner + Tailscale deploy wired up
- [ ] Production launch on the home VM
- [ ] Post-launch: 30-day stability, then revisit LLM summarization with a real review process, then migrate to paid infrastructure once funded

## Known open items

- **PACER costs money per page**, not a flat quarterly fee — the pipeline needs to scope queries tightly and track spend, not just cap at "$30/qtr" and assume it holds.
- **OPM PLUM and White House scrapers are fragile by nature** (HTML scrapes with no API). They need to fail loudly on structural change, not silently return stale data — flagged in the original plan and still true.
- **Pipeline status resets on backend restart.** `pipeline_status.json` lives in the backend container's ephemeral filesystem (no volume — a named volume would hit the non-root-container permission trap), so `/internal/pipeline-status` returns 404 after a redeploy until the next scheduled/manual run. Member data itself is safe (Postgres volume); only the status file is transient.
- **Marketing site has no real social handles or support/donation link.** `frontend/lib/site-config.ts` ships with `socialLinks: []` and `supportUrl: null` on purpose rather than placeholder/fake links — fill them in as real accounts and a donation link exist.
- **Favicon is a stopgap crop**, not a designed icon mark — see README → *Sites & branding*. Fine for now, worth revisiting once there's a proper icon-only asset.
- **DNS not yet configured** for the `app.` subdomain split. `frontend/middleware.ts` assumes `app.govmap.us` resolves to the same deployment as `govmap.us` — that DNS record (and matching `cloudflared` routing) needs to exist before the split works in production.
- **The `/congress` map is a computed seat-chart, not geographic.** `CongressCartogram` draws one dot per member (a hemicycle) because congressional-district geometry can't be generated or downloaded on the static build box. The geographic upgrade — real district polygons — is deferred; when built it must stay self-contained (serve simplified geometry from our own API or a committed asset, **never** per-visitor third-party map tiles/tracking).
- **Campaign finance needs `FEC_API_KEY`.** `fec_finance.py` (OpenFEC candidate totals) is fail-soft: without a free DATA.gov key it records a non-fatal error and the member page shows no finance section. The key must be **both** in the VM `.env` **and** wired into the backend `environment:` block in `docker-compose.yml` (a value in `.env` alone is only used for `${...}` substitution — it isn't injected into the container automatically; same as `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY`). v1 is topline totals only — **named top donors + industries** (Schedule A itemization or OpenSecrets, own key/attribution) is the next finance step.
- **Deploy runs CORE sources only.** `python -m app.pipelines.refresh` (the deploy step) refreshes just `members`, `bills`, `votes` — fast and well-behaved. The heavier / slow-cadence sources (`sponsored_bills`, `finance`, `zip_districts`) are in `EXTRA_REFRESHERS`, kept off the deploy hot path: they run on their own scheduler cadence (see `app/scheduler.py`) and on demand via `python -m app.pipelines.refresh <name>` (or `all`). A fresh environment should run `refresh all` once after the first deploy.
- **FEC finance queries by candidate id (targeted, ~20 calls).** `fec_finance` calls `GET /candidates/totals` filtered to **our members' candidate ids in batches of 50** (repeatable `candidate_id` + `cycle` params, `sort=-cycle`, newest wins across the last `_CYCLE_SPAN` cycles). This covers all three Senate classes + the House in ~20 targeted calls — no scanning the ~3500-candidate field, and well under api.data.gov's ~1000 req/hr. Earlier designs (one call per member ~537; then an untargeted per-cycle bulk sweep ~100+) both burned the hourly budget. Idempotent (upsert on `(bioguide, cycle)`). **The budget still resets hourly** — if a run 429s because the hour is already spent (from prior runs), wait for the reset and run once.
- **Ruff is pinned via `backend/ruff.toml`.** CI runs an unpinned `pip install ruff`, whose default rule set shifts between releases; without a config, a new ruff version turned the lint red on unchanged code (B008 on every FastAPI `Depends`, UP on Alembic boilerplate, BLE/DTZ on intentional patterns). The config sets a deterministic `select = [E, F, UP, B]`, ignores `B008` (FastAPI idiom), and excludes `migrations/`.
- **ZIP crosswalk uses HUD (needs `HUD_API_TOKEN`).** Confirmed via directory listing that Census publishes **no** ZCTA↔CD relationship file (`rel2020/zcta520/` pairs ZCTA with county/place/tract/tabblock/cousub only). `zip_crosswalk.py` now uses the authoritative **HUD USPS ZIP→CD crosswalk** (huduser.gov, type 5), token as a Bearer header. Free token from huduser.gov; must also be in the backend `environment:` block (it is: `HUD_API_TOKEN`). Fail-soft without it — `/api/lookup` returns empty and the `/congress` ZIP box shows "couldn't match" until it's set + `refresh zip_districts` runs.
